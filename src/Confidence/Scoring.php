/**
 * How a Confidence contest scores and ranks. A pure rule, tested in
 * tests/run.php.
 *
 * A correct pick earns its value. A wrong pick costs nothing, half its value
 * (rounded down) or all of it, by the same three penalty choices the full
 * board's confidence mode offers. A pick on a game not yet decided, or on a
 * drawn game, counts for nothing either way.
 *
 * 🚨 Not floored at zero. With a penalty on, a bad week IS a negative week, and
 * a season is the sum of its weeks — a floor on each week would make the
 * season table disagree with the weeks it is made of.
 *
 * Ties: the most points, then the closest tiebreaker guess (no guess, or no
 * result yet, ranks behind any guess), then the most correct picks.
