 * Single source of truth for "what week are we currently in".
 *
 * A week is current if it has at least one game not yet finished (status
 * scheduled / in_progress). We take the most recent season that still has an
 * unfinished game, then the earliest unfinished week within it — so future
 * unplayed weeks in a later season never jump ahead of the true current week.
 *
 * Previously this two-step query was copy-pasted as raw Capsule queries into
 * five controllers; centralising it here (in Eloquent) means the active-season
 * definition lives in one place.
