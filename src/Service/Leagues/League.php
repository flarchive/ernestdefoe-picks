 * the NFL are both `gridiron` because a recap of either says the same words
 * about yards and turnovers; the Premier League and MLS are both `soccer`. The
 * distinction matters because there are far more leagues than there are ways to
 * describe a game, and pretending otherwise means writing the same sentences
